# todo-demo
> ToDo App for demo purposes

## Basic Layout
This repo consists of a backend server (`todo_backend`) and a front end (`todo_frontend`).
The backend is written in Python using Django Rest Framework (DRF) while the front end is written in javascript using React.

## The Goal
My primary focus was to create a usable app in the frameworks that AcreTrader uses. I think that I did accomplish that, although I will say if I could do it over again I would have spend more time on the backend and learning how to set up authentication. As it stands I think I underestimated how long it would take me on the frontend and I was only able to implement some very basic authentication with username and password.

## Learning Moments
One of the key things I learned during this demo was just how much functionality Django gives the user right out of the box. I was very pleased to see that with very little code on my part I had implemented CRUD on a todo object.
I was also pleased to note that migrations work much the same way as Ruby on Rails, so that concept was easy to grasp, as well as object relational mapping.

## Running the app
Please see each individual README for instructions on how to run the app locally.
